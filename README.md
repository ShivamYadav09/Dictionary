# Dictionary
Implementation of a dictionary using Python. Uses dictionary.json file to look up the meaning(s) of the word. If the word is not present in the dictionary then it uses the SequenceMatcher module to find the most probable option and displays it to the user and asks for confirmation if he meant to search that.
